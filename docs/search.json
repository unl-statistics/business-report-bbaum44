    "text": "A.2 Data Source 1: BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII)\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics n.d.b)\nWho collected it: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), with state agency partners.\nWhy it was collected: Required by the OSH Act of 1970 to track nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses nationwide.\nWhat it contains: Annual nonfatal injury and illness counts and rates by industry, occupation, and event type (e.g., falls, slips, trips). Key measures include Total Recordable Case (TRC) rates, Days Away From Work (DAFW) rates, and median days away from work. (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2026b)\nWhen: Published annually. Most recent release covers 2023–2024 (published January 22, 2026).\nWhere: U.S. private industry and state/local government establishments. Excludes federal workers and the self-employed.\nHow: A stratified random sample of 200,000 employers report injuries from their OSHA 300 Log. BLS calculates incidence rates per 100 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers.\nStructure: Published as XLSX and HTML tables. The dta shows injury rates by NAICS industry code, SOC occupation code, and event/exposure type. Suppressed cells are shown as a dash (—).\nQuality control: BLS calculates relative standard errors for all estimates and flags unreliable cells. (Known limitation: employer self-reporting may undercount injuries).\nLicense: Public domain (U.S. federal government). Free to use and download.\nRelevance to report: Tables R4/R8 (industry × event type) and R9/R100 (occupation × event type) allow direct comparison of fall injury rates between office-sector and manufacturing industries. Median DAFW measures injury severity.",

Suppressed values shown as a dash (—).\nQuality control: Each case is independently verified through multiple source documents.\nLicense: Public domain (U.S. federal government).
